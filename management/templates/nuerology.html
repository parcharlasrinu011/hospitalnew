                    <b>NON SURICAL NUERO TREATMENTS</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Anti-seizure medications. These drugs can help stop or control seizures and are also prescribed to relieve pain that sometimes comes with nerve injury, damage or degeneration.<br>
Blood thinners. Simple drugs like aspirin or clopidogrel go a long way toward preventing stroke. Stronger blood thinners may be needed in selected cases.<br>
Corticosteroids and disease-modifying drugs. These medications alter the immune system and are often prescribed for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
 They may reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms in relapsing-remitting MS or slow the progression of secondary progressive MS.<br>
Dopaminergic medications. The most widely prescribed drugs for patients with Parkinson’s disease help produce or mimic dopamine, and reduce symptoms such as muscle rigidity, slow body movement, poor coordination and tremors.
